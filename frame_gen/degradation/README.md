# Frame Degradation

This directory contains scripts and resources related to frame degradation simulation and analysis.

## Contents

- `frame_degradation_simulator.py`: Main script for simulating various types of frame degradation
- `video_with_degrad_mk11_1080p.mp4`: Sample video demonstrating degradation effects

## Usage

The frame degradation simulator can be used to apply various degradation effects to video frames, such as:
- Motion blur
- Compression artifacts
- Noise
- Resolution reduction
- Frame rate reduction

## Dependencies

The degradation scripts require the following Python packages:
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- SciPy

These dependencies are listed in the main project's requirements files.
